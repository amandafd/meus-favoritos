                    <!--TODO: Review the translation. Explain wath is CAPS-->
                    <p class="about__text--paragraph">Born and raised in São Paulo - Brazil, I'm a <strong>Front-end developer, designer, artist</strong>and have a bachelor's degree in Fashion with a qualification in Product Management by Centro Universitário FIAM FAAM. I've <a href="portfolio.html" class="about__text--link">projects</a> developed in <em>HTML, CSS, Javascript, React</em>, using design concepts and arts with the most diverse techniques. I love studying and connecting knowledge from different areas, getting my hands dirty.</p><br>
                    <p class="about__text--paragraph">During my academic career I developed knowledge and skills that allow much more than working with the development of clothing collections. I realized that I could integrate everything I learned about product management, design and consumer behavior to work with the development of any product or service that impacts on different levels in the daily lives of the most diverse consumer profiles.</p><br>
                    <p class="about__text--paragraph">I worked within the Fashion area as a style assistant and photographer until 2019, the year in which I joined as an arts workshoper at CAPS Sapopemba. The public health challenges and the region where I worked, combined with a multidisciplinary and very competent team at different levels, I had a period of intense personal and professional maturity. During this period I was able to understand what I would like to develop in my next years. I have dedicated myself to the technology area since 2021, starting with UX|UI Design and moving on to Front-end development. I also continue to develop personal artistic projects and occasionally for clients: I work with traditional illustration techniques, mosaic, collage and origami.</p><br>
                    <p class="about__text--paragraph">I take great pleasure in the learning process, having been attracted to the technology area by the fascination with its dynamism and possibilities.</p>
